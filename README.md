# UX

### Strategy

My strategy for the site was to provide content and ease of access to users and fans trying to attain information by utilising the key UX principals.
I believe that giving credible, valuable and usable infos were higly significant to implement in the project. By proving the best features/technologies the customeners and fans want.

###### Ideal users of the website:

_ Fan of Blues-Rock musics
_ Festival promoter
_ Venue managers

###### These users are looking for:

_ An music expercience, a professional artist
_ Evidence of promotional work


The website was made in a way to not overwelme the users with clean and ituative information and navigation.
Most of the users discover artist from their mobile phones, so therefore creating something responvise was essential.

# Scope

In order to achieve the discovery and strategy goals, the following features wwere included in this release:

- Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
- Banner section in carousel style to showcase some straight forward actions
- Three favourite music streaming platforms ready to be clicked and listen
- Three video of the artist's performance to showcase his live talent and charisma
- A short biography with pictures along side to make the reading easy and contectual
- A stylish gallery to showcases some perfomances and artist style
- Simple Contact form
- Footer containing links to social media

# Structure

This is a single-page website to allow the easiest navigation possible. With the conventional navigation bar at the top allows effortless move in the page 
to whatever section the user wants to go to with a scrollspy to information easly where they are in the page. I've chosen the following order for the information
"Home/Carousel -> Music -> Video -> Biography -> Gallery -> Contact" because I felt this would allow the information to be disgested in the best way. While allowing the user to learn more about the artist, music and experience they could have, and finishing with the contact form to call them for an action.
